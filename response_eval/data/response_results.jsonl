Specifically, it involves gathering the model's incorrect outputs, categorizing and analyzing the types of errors, and using these insights to guide improvements. For instance, in traditional machine learning, this could mean collecting all incorrect classifications, grouping them into error subtypes (like confusing muffins for Chihuahuas), and determining if the problem is with the data, labeling, or model itself. In the context of large language models (LLMs), which deal with more open-ended tasks, error analysis involves manually reviewing model outputs for a set of inputs, taking notes on any issues, grouping those errors into categories, and then targeting the most frequent or severe error types for improvement. This process helps developers focus on the most impactful improvements for their AI systems, leading to more reliable and effective outcomes.", "citations": [{"video_id": "982V2ituTdc", "title": "How to Improve LLM Apps with Error\u00a0Analysis"}, {"video_id": "_tFXHsNKWS8", "title": "5 Mistakes AI Builders Make (and how to avoid them)"}]}

Like autocomplete on your smartphone, LLMs take into account randomness during text generation. This randomness can lead to different word choices or completions for the same prompt each time you run it. As stated: \"an llm is essentially a word predictor meaning given a sequence of words it produces the most likely next word ... what makes llms different ... is that they can take this ability to simply predict the next word and generate humanlike and helpful responses\". Since there can be multiple likely next words, the model may pick different continuations each time, especially if a degree of randomness (temperature or sampling) is involved in the generation process.", "citations": [{"video_id": "ytmK_ErTWss", "title": "LLMs EXPLAINED in 60 seconds #ai"}]}

This highlights specific, clearly defined misclassifications and provides direct insight for targeted improvement, such as adding missing data examples or correcting mislabeled data.\n\nIn contrast, error analysis for LLMs must be adapted because LLM outputs are much more open-ended and there may not be a clear right or wrong answer. The process involves:\n1. Curating realistic inputs, generating outputs with the LLM, and manually reviewing all results.\n2. Writing open-ended notes about failures (e.g., weak hooks, uncharacteristic structure), then categorizing these into error types after reviewing many samples.\n3. Automating evaluation is more challenging since subjective quality and creativity are involved.\n\nThus, while traditional error analysis focuses on clustering clear, discrete errors, LLM error analysis involves nuanced, manual review of open-ended outputs and identification of qualitative failure patterns, which later may be partially automated, but always with more complexity than in classic AI systems.", "citations": [{"video_id": "982V2ituTdc", "title": "How to Improve LLM Apps with Error\u00a0Analysis"}]}

Curate Realistic Inputs: Gather a set of real or highly realistic sample inputs that represent what your app will actually encounter in use.\n2. Generate Outputs: Pass these inputs through your AI app to produce outputs.\n3. Manual Review and Annotation: Use a custom data annotation tool (like Streamlit or Gradio) to make manual review efficient. For each input-output pair, write open-ended notes identifying model mistakes, issues, or things you don't like about the output.\n4. Categorize Errors: Review your annotation notes and cluster the mistakes into error subtypes or categories. Analyze how frequently each error type occurs.\n5. Prioritize and Fix: Focus on the most common or severe failure modes first, and iteratively update your system (for example, by refining prompts or retraining models) to address them.\n6. (Optional, for advanced workflows) Automate Evaluations: Once your error categories stabilize, create code-based or LLM-based evals to automatically check outputs for these errors. This allows rapid iteration at scale and more objective measurement of improvements.\n\nThese steps provide a systematic way to find and fix the most impactful issues in your AI app, guiding your improvements based on actual failure patterns rather than random trial and error.", "citations": [{"video_id": "982V2ituTdc", "title": "How to Improve LLM Apps with Error\u00a0Analysis"}, {"video_id": "ayGdRbMDZcU", "title": "How to Improve AI Apps with (Automated) Evals"}, {"video_id": "1pQ_JNItjdo", "title": "5 AI Agents You Can Build This Weekend (beginner to advanced)"}]}

Categorize the types of errors you observe, such as bad hooks, missing insights, structural issues, or failure to follow instructions. This will guide what needs to be detected automatically later. \n\n2. **Define Evaluations for Failure Modes**: For each major failure mode you identify, create an evaluation function. Some of these can be simple rule-based checks (e.g., word count, keyword presence, formatting) and implemented in Python using if/else logic or regular expressions. For more complex or subjective failures, use an LLM-based evaluation, where a separate LLM acts as a judge to assess qualities like tone, style match, or whether a hook is effective.\n\n3. **Automate the Error Checks**: Implement these evaluations as functions that accept the LLM output and return pass/fail or categorical results. Integrate these checks into your main LLM loop, so after each output is generated, it is immediately run through this suite of evaluations.\n   - If a check fails, generate targeted feedback (possibly using predefined templates) and feed it back to the LLM for another iteration.\n   - Repeat the loop until all evaluations pass or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n4. **Extend Checks Over Time**: As you run more cycles and encounter new failure modes, add corresponding automated checks to your evaluation suite. Over time, this should reduce reliance on manual review and accelerate the iteration cycle.\n\nThis process is described and demonstrated in full using Python code and various types of evals in the video \"LLM in a Loop: Automate feedback with evals.\" The error analysis and categorization process, and the transition toward automation of those checks, are detailed step by step in \"How to Improve LLM Apps with Error Analysis.\"", "citations": [{"video_id": "6VcXukJuGA0", "title": "LLM in a Loop: Automate feedback with evals"}, {"video_id": "982V2ituTdc", "title": "How to Improve LLM Apps with Error\u00a0Analysis"}]}
