This process involves collecting instances where the model performs poorly or makes incorrect decisions, categorizing these mistakes into subtypes, and analyzing their frequency and impact. For example, in traditional machine learning, error analysis might involve reviewing incorrectly classified images and grouping them based on the nature of the confusion. By examining these grouped errors, practitioners can determine specific patterns or failure modes\u2014such as the model confusing similar-looking categories\u2014which then informs changes like adjusting training data or model prompts to target these weaknesses. Error analysis is particularly crucial for probabilistic systems like large language models (LLMs), where outputs vary and correctness may be subjective. In such cases, the process is adapted to include manual review and categorization of model outputs, enabling developers to focus improvements on the most impactful error types, thereby making the AI system more reliable and effective[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=982V2ituTdc)[[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tFXHsNKWS8)[[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pQ_JNItjdo).", "citations": [{"video_id": "982V2ituTdc", "title": "How to Improve LLM Apps with Error\u00a0Analysis"}, {"video_id": "_tFXHsNKWS8", "title": "5 Mistakes AI Builders Make (and how to avoid them)"}, {"video_id": "1pQ_JNItjdo", "title": "5 AI Agents You Can Build This Weekend (beginner to advanced)"}], "metadata": {"answer_length": 1363, "citation_count": 3, "contains_refusal": false}}

This means that, even with the same input, the model may choose different valid next words each time, leading to varied outputs. This variability is influenced by settings like temperature, which control how much randomness is allowed in the generation process.

Instead, it requires curating a diverse set of realistic inputs, generating outputs, and then manually reviewing these outputs to write open-ended notes on mistakes, inconsistencies, or quality issues. Categories of errors are developed after reviewing many example outputs, making the process more iterative and qualitative.

For example, empirical data can be fitted to a power law and the alpha extracted: if \u03b1 is close to or below 2, the distribution produces very large rare events and has infinite variance; if \u03b1 drops below 1, even the mean becomes undefined[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcqt49dXtm8)[[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kd9OPn7tw).
