      "Overfitting is a problem for decision trees because they can become overly complex by creating too many splits that perfectly classify the training data, often resulting in a large and intricate tree. This leads the model to be overly optimized to the training data, capturing noise and specific patterns that do not generalize well to new, unseen data. As explained, \"overfitting is when you learn a machine learning model based on some data set but your model becomes over optimized on the data set it was trained on and when you try to apply that model to new data that it's never seen before you'll find that your model is actually very inaccurate.\" Therefore, an overfit decision tree may have perfect prediction on the training data but poor performance on test data. Using hyperparameters to control the growth of the tree (like limiting depth or splits) can help mitigate overfitting and improve generalizability to new data.\n",
